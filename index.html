                    <p>I have been fascinated with computers since i was a child and built my first PC in my sophomore year of highschool. In 2022 I graduated from Texas State University with a B.A. in Psychology. After my daughter was born I made the decision to change career paths and started learning how to code through Codecademy.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>I am now experienced in front-end coding languages such as Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I have plans to continue my coding education to become a full-stack web-developer and eventually expand into other areas of programming.</p>
